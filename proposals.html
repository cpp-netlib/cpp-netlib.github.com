              <p>This document outlines how we get new libraris accepted as

                <h1>Preparation</h1>
              </div>
              <p>The maintainers and members of the community generally like
              seeing well-prepared proposals for libraries to be included. The
              reason for this is so that we waste as little time from everyone
              who's going to be involved in the process as possible. Therefore
              we ask that before you bring an idea to the table, please prepare
              the following information (even only when sending an email to the
              mailing list).</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Problem Statement.</strong> It's surprisingly hard to
              evaluate proposals without a problem being solved. To make it
              easier to evaluate proposals, please define what problem you're
              intending to solve with the library you're proposing to include
              (if it's already there, that's good &mdash; if it's going to be
              developed from scratch, it's easier to know what the problem is
              before we start).</li>
              <li><strong>User Stories.</strong> We generally like to evaluate
              libraries based on how easy it is for users to use. It is then
              paramout that you present a vision on how users of the library
              will be using the library. Examples of user code would be most
              appreciated.</li>
              <li><strong>Scope and Goals.</strong> Knowing what the scope of
              your library will be is better generally so that interested
              parties who want to help in development and maintenance can see
              whether they can help or whether you can do it all on your own.
              Knowing what you want to accomplish and sharing those with the
              community of users and developers gives everyone the same ideas
              as to what to expect.</li>
              <li><strong>Design Documentation.</strong> API design is hard,
              and having a high level idea of how things will be implemented in
              your library makes it easier to see the bigger picture. This
              document need not be too formal but it should be something
              self-contained and easily modified/commented-on for a lower
              collaboration bar. Please do not put your design document as an
              email &mdash; a Wiki document, shared Google Document, or a
              GitHub repository is much easier to discuss than an email.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Once you have these things, fire off an email to the mailing
              list citing the above four preparation sections.<p>
            </section>
            <section id="discussion">
              <div class="page-header">
                <h1>Discussion</h1>
              </div>
              <p>All discussions should occur in the mailing list for issues
              not related to the design documentation. If the design doc is a
              shared Google Document comments will be made on the document
              itself. For everything else, the discussions should be done on
              the mailing list.</p>
              <p>The discussion will be considered concluded when all the
              maintainers of the library agree that the proposal makes sense
              and that it's something the community wants to have in the
              library. The process will be tracked by a formal survey on the
              mailing list run by one of the maintainers.</p>
              <p>Once everybody's convinced that things should move forward,
              then maintainers and interested contributors hunker down to start
              collaborating on the development of the library.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="collaboration">
              <div id="page-header">
                <h1>Collaboration</h1>
              </div>
              <p>The collaboration process is intended to be much simpler: all
              discussions on progress and questions to clarify happen on the
              mailing list. Matters affecting progress &mdash; developers
              missing in action, thorny implementation details, blockers, and
              style questions should be discussed all in the open. We encourage
              this so that everyone in the community is involved in the process
              where we exclude nobody's opinion and contributions.</p>
              <p>As far as development is concerned, there are two main ways of
              getting the development done. Each one has its merits so we
              present both.</p>
              <h2>Fork of cpp-netlib</h2>
              <p>The fork process is straight-forward &mdash; whoever proposed
              the library and those who have pledged to contribute to the
              implementation shall fork the main repository and develop in
              parallel as the main repository. They can send progress reports
              to the main developer list and have the partially complete work
              merged into the master branch as it gets completed. All changes
              can be isolated to an external fork where changes are meant to be
              integrated before being submitted in bulk to the main repo as a
              single PR.</p>
              <p>This process effectively promotes whomever is driving and
              owning the process as a maintainer of cpp-netlib. The downside to
              this is that it's a lot of responsibility and may be time
              consuming.</p>
              <h2>Submodule to cpp-netlib</h2>
              <p>The submodule approach is much more decoupled and allows for
              having the implemented library be as stand-alone as possible.
              Some libraries in cpp-netlib are already submodules and are
              maintained separately by the corresponding maintainer.</p>
              <p>The problem with this approach is that coordinating breaking
              changes on multiple interacting submodules will be much harder.
              It also makes the release/development process much more
              cumbersome than the fork model. It also makes it harder to
              enforce the style guide and development processes on the
              submodule.</p>
              <h2>Preferred Mode</h2>
              <p>The preferred mode of development is the fork model, where
              coordination is much closer and much more explicit. It also
              allows the maintainers to easily cut releases and maintain a
              single repository unto which all changes and history can be
              kept.</p>
              <p>Only in rare circumstances will a submodule actually be
              preferred &mdash; for instance, if the project has already been
              in existence before being accepted into <code>cpp-netlib</code>
              or if it's made sufficiently stand-alone for purposes of
              inclusion into the standard library.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="inclusion">
              <div class="page-header">
                <h1>Inclusion</h1>
              </div>
              <p>Inclusion entails three specific things which will
              differentiate any other library from an accepted
              <code>cpp-netlib</code> library.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Maintainership.</strong> All current maintainers of
              <code>cpp-netlib</code> get maintainership over the library
              that's accepted, and the proposer and main developers of the
              library become maintainers of <code>cpp-netlib</code> as well. We
              usually defer library-specific issues to the main library
              maintainer/developer but in case of whole-library and community
              decisions all maintainers get the same responibilities.</li>
              <li><strong>Support.</strong> Any included library shall be
              supported by the community and maintainers until it is either
              removed or retired.</li>
              <li><strong>Distribution.</strong> Any library included into
              <code>cpp-netlib</code> shall be distributed as part of the main
              distribution.
              </ul>
              <p>On the note about maintainership &mdash; once someone is
              promoted to maintainer of cpp-netlib, that person gets
              administrative rights to the project repository. In the event
              that someone becomes inactive or relinquishes the role, only then
              will that person be considered an ex-maintainer.</p>
              <p>This means, once someone is deemed a maintainer, he'll always
              be considered a maintainer unless he becomes inactive or
              relinquishes that role.</p>
